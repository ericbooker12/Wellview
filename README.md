# Wellview

Wellview is an ongoing project that I created to utilize the features of D3.js. The app takes data from geothermal wells that were drilled in Northern California and displays it in an easy-to-read graphical format. It uses Ruby on Rails for the backend and JavaScript, specifically the D3.js library, for the front end.

Because this project is meant to be a vehicle to play with the features of D3.js, the nav-bar links are currently only dummy links so logging in as a user is not possible or neccesary. Perhaps in the future, when I revisit this project, I will add that functionality so that users can interact with the data in different ways.

# Key Features

## Data parser in db/seeds.rb
### This is a customized data parser that I wrote to parse through thousands of lines text file to pull out and format the data needed to graph. It stores the data in a database so that the program no longer relies on the text files.

## D3.js
### This was one of the funnest technologies for me to learn. Although challenging at times, it was very satisfying to watch it create meaning charts from otherwise unreadable data.

The current iteration for the Hackathon features a counting game -- if time had permitted, we would have created an **Augmented Reality Treasure Hunt**!

## APIs
VisaDirect  
Marqeta  

### Context
In 2015, Gift Card sales reached a new peak of $130 BILLION dollars. Holidays, birthdays, celebratory occasionsâ€¦ The versatile gift card is an easy gift... but can it *seem* too easy and thereby leave us feeling guilty for not sending a more personalized gift?   

The underlying psychology of giving weaves a complex web of emotions. GameGyft alleviates this dynamic by adding personalization and delight to the gift card industry.
